I have been thinking of starting a website for a while, a platform that would allow me to share thoughts 
and perhaps connect with likeminded people.

This website has different purposes:

- Structure and elaborate years of journal notes, reading and listening
- Share my current challenges and solutions I implement in my daily life
- Inspire and maybe federate people who recognize themself in this journey
- Push my creativity to grow this site with quality content
- Debate and challenge my believes
- Improve my writting

I chose the name the Jungle Book not because the Walt Disney cartoon is part of my childhood or because my upbringing 
was radically different from my counterparts but rather like Rudyard Kipling poem's _If-_, 
I strive to clear a path in this economic, technological and social jungle of our time. 

For the moment, I would like to dissociate this blog from my professional life and remain anonymous in order to express myself 
with no filters as I would like to share eclectic and unconventional thoughts without impacting my career.
