I have been thinking of starting a website for a while, a tool that would allow me to share thoughts and make unique connections.  
 
This website has different purposes:
- Structure and elaborate years of journal notes, reading and listening
- Share my current challenges and hopefully solutions (accountability)
- Motivate, inspire, federate people who recognize themself in this journey
- Find people that thinks alike or on the contrary folks who would challenge my believes and push me beyond my dogmas
- Becoming better at writting and doing in so in the English language
- To push my introspection and concentration further
- To force my creativity and proactivity in order to grow this site with quality content  
(readings, writting, research, questionning, reflection, dialogue...)
